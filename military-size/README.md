# U.S. Military Size

The [Defense Manpower Data Center](https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/appj/dwp/index.jsp) appears to the be the central source for data on the current size, rankings, and deployment of the U.S. military. The [reporters page](https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/appj/dwp/dwp_reports.jsp) is the place to start. It will require some tedious copying and pasting of different Excel files, but it has granular info active duty by month and gender.

There are also XLS files with information about which state active-duty members come from, broken down by domestic and oversees deployments.
