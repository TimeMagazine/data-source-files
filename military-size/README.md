# U.S. Military Size

The [Defense Manpower Data Center](https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/appj/dwp/index.jsp) appears to the be the central source for data on the current size, rankings, and deployment of the U.S. military. The [reporters page](https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/appj/dwp/dwp_reports.jsp) is the place to start. 

The R code in this directory is just for parsing the three different species of XLS files that go back to 1954, but there's more here as well, such as info on what states active-duty members come from and breakdowns by gender. So this is just a start.
