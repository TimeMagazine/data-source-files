# Interesting Data Sources

I find that I often come across caches of reliable, granular data when searching for something that are not immediately relevant but could be useful for a future idea. Please add anything you come across to the this repo. That includes anything you regularly use that needs any sort of documentation or cautionary tales. 

Each source should have it's own, clearly named folder, with a README.md in that folder briefly detailing the data, the source, and a link. Feel free to add any useful code as well, but it isn't necessary.
