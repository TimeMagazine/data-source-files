# A few sources of data on Immigrant population in the United States

[DHS Yearbook of Immigration Statistics] (https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/yearbook)

Official data on Immigrants, Law-ful residents, Temporary (Students, Tourists) and Refugees from the Department of Homeland Security.

[Cenus ACS / IPUMS] (https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/group?id=race_eth)

IPUMS ACS has nativity variables including Citizenship status, Place of Birth (Foreign) and Year of Immigration/Entry to U.S. which can be combined with other demographic information.

IPUMS CPS also has similar variables [CPS] (https://cps.ipums.org/cps-action/variables/group?id=eth_nat)

*Note:* Some of this information has been compiled by the MPP into neat State-level reports which might prove more helpful for smaller pieces.

[Remittance Data - Worldbank] (https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/migrationremittancesdiasporaissues/brief/migration-remittances-data)

Remittance data providdes an amazing insight into folks sending money back to their origin countries from income earned in source countries. It provides a different perspective on immigrants and their relationship to their home countries, also providing for data that could capture illegal immigrants remittances (if they send money back through any legitimate channel). Also on the same page is Migration Data from the World Bank that is updated regularly.

[Foreign born workers - Bureau of Labor Statistics] (https://www.bls.gov/cps/demographics.htm#foreignborn)

Data on foreign bork workers, extracted from the CPS data (linked above) with other data estimates w.r.t. Unemployment and Wages.

[Prevailing Wage Data - Dept. of Labor] (http://www.flcdatacenter.com/)

Data on prevailing wages for foreign workers, used by employers sponsoring work visas. How much are foreign workers getting paid?

[Overview of various sources from Migration Policy Project] (http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/frequently-requested-statistics-immigrants-and-immigration-united-states)

They provide links to lots of other sources of data, including synthetic sources extracted from Census in the form of "State Profiles". For eg: [Texas] (http://www.migrationpolicy.org/data/state-profiles/state/demographics/TX)

**Also of note**: Their measures of Illegal Immigrant Population (based on Census and other surveys - researching methodology now.) http://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/data-hub/charts/unauthorized-immigrant-populations-country-and-region-top-state-and-county
